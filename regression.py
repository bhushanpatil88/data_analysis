#Support vector regressor
'''
scale the data
It uses the hyperplane as a regression line 
It tries to cover every point inside the support vector
classifiers
The points on the line and outside the line are called support vectors
The error cost is distance of every point outside the classifier(slack variables) with the classifier lines
